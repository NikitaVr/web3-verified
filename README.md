You can get this data by fetching https://nikitavr.github.io/web3-verified/education.json 

There is also an npm package for this https://www.npmjs.com/package/web3-verified

# Roadmap

## Decentralization

The goal is to keep this credentials system as fault-proof as possible, we are exploring alternative to Github such as https://radicle.xyz/

We are also looking into adding a voting based mechanism that determines which contracts and wallet addresses are added as verified.

## Trusted Issuers

Wallets that are marked as trusted certificate issuers will have the ability to have newly created certificate contracts to be auto-approved
